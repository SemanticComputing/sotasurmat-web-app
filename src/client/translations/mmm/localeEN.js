            This definition is not shared by the Bibale or Oxford Libraries’ conception
            of the term, which both define their internal “work” concept more closely to
            the FRBRoo conception of an Expression. The SDBM does not have a work concept
            at all, recording only the titles of the texts as given in its various sources,
            without normalizing that data or linking it directly to author information.
            Works were generated within the MMM dataset by manually creating links across
            the three datasets’ various conceptions of the relationship between authors
            and their creations. This process was not able to reconcile every work
